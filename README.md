**1) Background**  
Visually impaired people have a lot of trouble getting around by bus. It is very common to miss a bus because it is difficult to know if you have arrived at the correct bus stop or if the bus you need to ride has arrived. Also, it is not easy to find and press the drop-off bell even after getting on the bus, so it can often be difficult to get off at the bus stop where you need to get off. Since it is not easy to use the bus, which is the easiest to use for most people, there are many cases of using a call taxi for the disabled, which is expensive and has a long waiting time. Therefore, we noticed that there is a need for a solution that allows the visually impaired to enjoy a fair and convenient public transport bus environment like the non-disabled.

**2) Solution**  
We want to provide an application that allows visually impaired people to get to their destinations by using buses in the same way as non-disabled people. If they register their destination through our application 'Buppy (Bus + Puppy)', it guides them to the bus stop to go to that destination, and helps them get on the bus safely without missing it. Even after getting on the bus, they can receive the alarm before getting off the bus and they can conveniently get to their destination with detail guide.
Also,  the bus driver can help them to get on the bus as much as possible by receiving the alarm that they should wait for a second for them.


**3) Effect**  
- Based on GPS, visually impaired people can easily find a bus stop without the help from people around them and can quickly get on the bus by finding the location of the bus that they should take. 
- The convenience of the visually impaired people can be improved by notifying the bus drivers in advance and propose them to wait for an additional 5 seconds.
- Through detailed route guidance from the departure point to the destination point, it shortens the time required for visually impaired people to move, which forms a barrier-free mobility area and broaden the area of activity.
